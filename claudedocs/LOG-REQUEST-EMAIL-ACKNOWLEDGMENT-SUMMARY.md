# LOG Request Email Acknowledgment Feature - Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the email acknowledgment feature added to the LOG request workflow, allowing users to receive automatic confirmation emails when they submit LOG requests.

## Key Changes

### 1. User Experience Enhancement

**Before:**
- User requests LOG â†’ Support team receives email â†’ User gets no confirmation

**After:**
- User requests LOG â†’ Email input appears (optional)
- User enters email â†’ Support team receives email â†’ **User receives instant acknowledgment email**
- User skips email â†’ Support team receives email â†’ No user acknowledgment (optional)

### 2. New Components

#### Frontend Components
1. **EmailInput.jsx** - New component
   - Blue background section (distinct from file attachments)
   - Email validation with real-time feedback
   - Optional field (can skip)
   - Helper text: "ðŸ’¡ We'll send you a confirmation when your LOG request is received"

2. **MessageInput.jsx** - Enhanced
   - Shows/hides email input on demand
   - Two-step LOG request flow:
     - First click: Show email input
     - Second click: Submit with email (or skip)
   - Validates email before allowing submission

#### Backend Services
1. **sendAcknowledgmentEmail()** - New function in `email.js`
   - Sends professional HTML acknowledgment email to user
   - Includes reference ID, request summary, next steps
   - Fails gracefully (doesn't block LOG request if acknowledgment fails)

### 3. Database Schema Updates

**New Fields in `log_requests` table:**
```sql
user_email VARCHAR(255)            -- User's email for acknowledgment
acknowledgment_sent BOOLEAN        -- Whether ack email was sent
acknowledgment_sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ -- When ack was sent
```

### 4. Email Templates

**Support Team Email** (existing - unchanged)
- Subject: "ðŸš¨ LOG Request - [Employee Name] - [Policy Type]"
- Contains: Employee details, conversation history, attachments
- Recipient: Support team email

**User Acknowledgment Email** (new)
- Subject: "âœ… LOG Request Received - Reference: [ID]"
- Contains:
  - âœ… Green checkmark header
  - Reference ID for tracking
  - Request summary (timestamp, attachments count)
  - Status: "Pending Review"
  - What happens next (3-step process)
  - Estimated response time (1-2 business days)
- Recipient: User's provided email

## Technical Implementation

### API Changes

**POST /api/chat/request-log**

Request body now accepts:
```json
{
  "sessionId": "string",
  "message": "string",
  "attachmentIds": ["array"],
  "userEmail": "string (optional, new)"
}
```

Response now includes:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "logRequestId": "uuid",
    "emailSent": true,
    "attachmentCount": 2,
    "acknowledgmentSent": true  // new field
  }
}
```

### State Management

**New Zustand Store State:**
```javascript
{
  userEmail: '',           // User's email address
  showEmailInput: false,   // Email input visibility
  setUserEmail: fn,        // Update email
  toggleEmailInput: fn     // Show/hide email input
}
```

### Email Service Functions

```javascript
// Existing - sends to support team
sendLogRequestEmail(data)

// New - sends acknowledgment to user
sendAcknowledgmentEmail({
  userEmail,
  userName,
  conversationId,
  attachmentCount
})
```

## Configuration

**No new environment variables needed!**

Uses existing Azure credentials:
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `LOG_REQUEST_EMAIL_FROM` (sends both support and acknowledgment emails)

## Testing

### Test Acknowledgment Email

Create `backend/test-acknowledgment.js`:
```javascript
import { sendAcknowledgmentEmail } from './api/services/email.js';

const testData = {
  userEmail: 'user@example.com',
  userName: 'John Doe',
  conversationId: 'test-123',
  attachmentCount: 2
};

sendAcknowledgmentEmail(testData)
  .then(result => console.log('âœ“ Success:', result))
  .catch(err => console.error('âœ— Failed:', err));
```

Run: `node backend/test-acknowledgment.js`
