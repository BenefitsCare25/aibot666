# Azure AD Setup Guide for LOG Request Email Feature (Delegated Permissions)

This guide will help you configure Azure AD with **delegated permissions** to enable email sending via Microsoft Graph API using a service account.

## Current Error

```
GraphError: Access is denied. Check credentials and try again.
statusCode: 403
code: ErrorAccessDenied
```

This means your Azure AD app needs proper delegated permissions configuration with a service account.

## ðŸŽ¯ Authentication Approach: Delegated Permissions with Service Account

Since you're using **Delegated permissions**, we use a **service account** (dedicated user account) to send emails on behalf of the organization.

**How it works:**
1. Create a dedicated service account (e.g., `notifications@yourcompany.com`)
2. Configure Azure AD app with delegated `Mail.Send` permission
3. Application authenticates as the service account using username/password
4. Emails are sent from the service account's mailbox

---

## Step-by-Step Azure AD Configuration

### Step 1: Create Service Account

1. Go to [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com)
2. Navigate to **Users** â†’ **Active users**
3. Click **Add a user**
4. Create account:
   - **Username**: `notifications@yourcompany.com` (or similar)
   - **Display name**: "Chatbot Notifications"
   - **Password**: Set a strong password and **disable password expiration**
5. Assign a license (at minimum, Exchange Online Plan 1 or Microsoft 365 Business Basic)
6. **Important**: Disable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for this service account
   - Go to user â†’ Security â†’ MFA status â†’ Disable
7. Save the username and password securely

### Step 2: Navigate to Azure Portal

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Sign in with your admin account
3. Search for "App registrations" in the top search bar
4. Click on **App registrations**

### Step 3: Find Your Application

1. Look for your app with Client ID: `d5042b07-f7dc-4706-bf6f-847a7bd1538d`
2. Click on the app name to open it

### Step 4: Configure Authentication Settings

**Note**: With the ROPC (Resource Owner Password Credentials) flow using client_secret, public client flows are NOT required.

1. In the left sidebar, click **Authentication**
2. No changes needed - the app uses confidential client authentication with client_secret
3. Verify that you have a valid client secret in **Certificates & secrets**

### Step 5: Add API Permissions (Delegated)

1. In the left sidebar, click **API permissions**
2. You should already have delegated permissions. Verify:
   - **Mail.Send** (Delegated)
   - **User.Read** (Delegated)
3. If not present, add them:
   - Click **+ Add a permission**
   - Select **Microsoft Graph**
   - Select **Delegated permissions** (NOT Application)
   - Search for `Mail.Send` and `User.Read`
   - Check both boxes
   - Click **Add permissions**

### Step 6: Grant Admin Consent (If Required)

1. Still on the **API permissions** page
2. If you see "Admin consent required" = Yes:
   - Click **"Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]"**
   - Click **Yes** when prompted
3. Wait for the status to show **"Granted for [Your Organization]"** with green checkmark âœ…

### Step 7: Verify Permissions

After configuration, you should see:

| Permission | Type | Admin Consent Required | Status |
|------------|------|------------------------|--------|
| Mail.Send | Delegated | Yes | âœ… Granted for [Org] |
| User.Read | Delegated | No | âœ… Granted for [Org] |

## Alternative: Use Shared Mailbox

If your organization restricts `Mail.Send` permission, you can use a shared mailbox approach:

### Option A: Application Access Policy

1. Create a shared mailbox (e.g., `notifications@yourcompany.com`)
2. Use PowerShell to grant app access to specific mailbox:

```powershell
# Connect to Exchange Online
Connect-ExchangeOnline

# Create application access policy
New-ApplicationAccessPolicy -AppId d5042b07-f7dc-4706-bf6f-847a7bd1538d -PolicyScopeGroupId notifications@yourcompany.com -AccessRight RestrictAccess -Description "Restrict app to notifications mailbox only"
```

### Option B: Use Mail.Send.Shared Permission

1. Instead of `Mail.Send`, add `Mail.Send.Shared` permission
2. Grant admin consent
3. Update your `.env` to use the shared mailbox email in `LOG_REQUEST_EMAIL_FROM`

---

## Environment Variables Configuration

After Azure AD is configured, update your Render environment variables:

### Required Variables (Delegated Permissions)

```bash
# Azure AD Configuration
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=d5042b07-f7dc-4706-bf6f-847a7bd1538d
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
AZURE_TENANT_ID=496f1a0a-6a4a-4436-b4b3-fdb75d235254

# Service Account Credentials (for Delegated Permissions)
AZURE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_USERNAME=notifications@yourcompany.com
AZURE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD=<service-account-password>

# Email Configuration
LOG_REQUEST_EMAIL_FROM=notifications@yourcompany.com
LOG_REQUEST_EMAIL_TO=support-team@yourcompany.com
LOG_REQUEST_KEYWORDS=request log,send logs,need log
```

**Important Notes:**
- `AZURE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_USERNAME` = The service account email you created in Step 1
- `AZURE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD` = The password for that service account
- `LOG_REQUEST_EMAIL_FROM` should match the service account email
- Ensure MFA is disabled for the service account

### How to Set on Render

1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Select your web service
3. Go to **Environment** tab
4. Add each variable above
5. Click **Save Changes**
6. Render will automatically redeploy your service

---

## Testing the Configuration

After setting up Azure AD and environment variables:

### Test 1: Check Environment Variables

```bash
# SSH into your Render instance or check logs
echo $AZURE_CLIENT_ID
echo $AZURE_TENANT_ID
# Do NOT echo AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET for security
```

### Test 2: Test Email Locally (if you have backend running locally)

```bash
cd backend
node test-email.js
```

Expected output:
```
Testing Email Service...
ðŸ“§ Test 1: Sending LOG Request Email to Support Team
âœ“ LOG request email sent successfully!
ðŸ“§ Test 2: Sending Acknowledgment Email to User
âœ“ Acknowledgment email sent successfully!
âœ“ All tests completed successfully!
```

### Test 3: Test from Widget

1. Open your chatbot
2. Click the paperclip icon ðŸ“Ž
3. Attach a test file
4. Click "Request LOG" button
5. Enter your email
6. Click "Request LOG" again
7. Check both:
   - Support team email inbox (should receive LOG request)
   - Your email inbox (should receive acknowledgment)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Access is denied" (403)

**Solution**:
- Verify admin consent granted for delegated permissions (Step 6)
- Ensure "Allow public client flows" is enabled (Step 4)
- Verify service account has correct permissions

### Issue: "Invalid username or password" (AADSTS50126)

**Solution**:
- Double-check `AZURE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_USERNAME` and `AZURE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD`
- Ensure the service account is active in Microsoft 365
- Verify MFA is disabled for the service account

### Issue: "Multi-factor authentication required" (AADSTS50076)

**Solution**: MFA must be disabled for the service account. Go to Microsoft 365 Admin Center â†’ Users â†’ Select service account â†’ Security â†’ Disable MFA.

### Issue: "Public client flows not allowed" or "client_secret required" (AADSTS7000218)

**Solution**: This error is now handled by using confidential client flow with client_secret. Ensure:
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` is set correctly in Render environment variables
- Client secret is valid and not expired in Azure Portal

### Issue: "Invalid client secret" (401)

**Solution**: The `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` is wrong or expired. Generate a new client secret:
1. Azure Portal â†’ App registrations â†’ Your app
2. Certificates & secrets â†’ + New client secret
3. Copy the secret value immediately (you won't see it again)
4. Update Render environment variable

### Issue: "Tenant does not exist" (400)

**Solution**: The `AZURE_TENANT_ID` is incorrect. Verify it in Azure Portal.

### Issue: Emails not sending but no errors

**Solution**:
- Check that `LOG_REQUEST_EMAIL_FROM` matches the service account email
- Verify the service account has an active Exchange Online license
- Check the service account mailbox is accessible

### Issue: File upload works but email fails

**Solution**: File upload uses local filesystem, email needs Azure AD. Focus on Azure AD configuration and service account setup.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets**: Keep `.env` in `.gitignore`
2. **Rotate secrets regularly**: Change client secret every 6-12 months
3. **Use least privilege**: Only grant `Mail.Send` permission, nothing more
4. **Monitor usage**: Check Azure AD sign-in logs regularly
5. **Use managed identity**: On Azure App Service, use managed identity instead of client secret

---

## Next Steps

After Azure AD is configured:

1. âœ… Grant admin consent for Mail.Send permission
2. âœ… Set environment variables on Render
3. âœ… Redeploy your Render service
4. âœ… Test email functionality
5. âœ… Monitor logs for any errors
